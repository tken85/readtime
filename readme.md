In this repository we have

1) index.html which runs the program and starts with our random cookbook post as a default
2) jquery.js and jquery-ui.min.js -two jquery libraries from jqueryui.com linked to allow jquery usage
3) posts.js which contains objects housing titles and text for the 3 post options.
4) main.js which has the main functions that calculates read time, allows the user to adjust readspeed, and allows you to change posts. At the end of the file is a commented out working jquery plug-in and an example of how to call it on the post area. Since I did not have time to adjust the rest of the code to work with it I left it commented out.
